      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        My full name is Keaton Patrick Brewster, and I am 21 years old.
        I am currently the manager at a coffee shop for PT's Coffe Roasting Company, and I have worked in the coffee industry since I was 17 years old. 
        I am really excited about all the things I am going to learn being a student in KU's coding program!

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Topeka, Kansas. My family an I lived in town until I was 7, and then we moved
        north 15 miles to a tiny town called Hoyt. Even though, at that point we didn't live "in" Topeka, we still did everything there
        as it was only a 15 minute drive. 
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        My hobbies include: playing games, spending time with friends, watching movies and playing the guitar.
        One of my favorite games to play is Super Smash Bros, and one of my favorite movies (among many) is the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        If I could work any job and not have to worry about how it would pay the bills
        I would probably want to be a studio musician. I love playing the guitar, and I can't imagine anything more fun!
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        I currently live in Kansas City, Missouri, and I have been here for a little bit under a year. 
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I want to be a web developer primaraly to get my feet into the field of programming and computer languages. 
        I do not see myself being a web developer forever, but I am excited to get into the feild and learn as much as I can!
